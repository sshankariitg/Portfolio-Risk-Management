# Portfolio-Management
In these project we use python to calculate the optimal portfolio and visualize the efficient frontier on share prices of CIPLA, APPLE, MICROSOFT, TESLA and GOOGLE.
in these we run loop on 5000 random portfolios and simulate the portfolio returns and risk then 
We calculate and distibute weights on basis on MIN VARIANCE, MAX SHARPE RATIO & MIN RISK to make the maximum return.
